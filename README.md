## Our Story

* Bongani Fruits began with a simple yet powerful vision, to provide individuals and families with a delectable and nutritious snacking option that aligns with their active lifestyles. The journey started with 4 South African entrepreneurs that saw an opportunity to turn locally provided fruits into a sustainable snack, as they say local is lekker. We have committed ourselves to source the finest, sun-ripened fruits across the country and transform them into an irresistible, wholesome snack.

## Setup

The structure and process of the website was largely based of the AirBnB projects conducted by ALX. This served as a stepping stone and guided me through the processes. The console and structure of folders are based of codes deployed in the AirBnB and restructured to suit the current requirements.

The project uses Python coding to build the back end and MySQL serve as the database. The images and information provided are from the product produced and that will be sold. The front end uses HTML5 and CSS3 to display the content and the python back end has urls as app routes to cycle through the information and display dynamic content.

For Deployment a server was purchased from Digital Ocean and setup was achieved using a Gunicorn service, which serves the app. Nginx was chosen to be the webserver and SSL crtificates were created with Certbot.
